# OLED-EQ
This repository contains an open dataset for energy consumption in OLED TVs while playing videos with various brightness levels. The dataset comprises the energy data of four OLED TVs with different screen sizes and manufacturers in playing 176 videos in a range of dark and bright content. As results, 704 data traces of energy consumption are collected.

Details and analysis can be found in the Reference section.


## Data Description
There are four main folders:
1. `energy-consumption`: includes energy consumption of the tested TVs for all tested videos with different luminance/brightness reduction levels and video bitrates.
2. `objective-score `: includes common metrics such as PSNR, SSIM and VMAF of the tested videos
3. `subjective-score`: includes the rating score given by every participant for each tested video
4. `test-sequence`: includes the tested videos
